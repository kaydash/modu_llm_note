PitchBook 연구 책임자는 시장이 “AI 진영과 비AI 진영, 대형 펀드와 소형 펀드”로 양분되고 있다고 전했다.

      "## Detailed Analysis\n",
      "2024년 AI 산업은 이미 확산된 기술들이 산업 전반에 깊숙이 자리잡으며, 다양한 응용 분야에서 혁신을 이끌고 있습니다. 특히, 대형 언어 모델(LLM)은 자연어 처리, 고객 서비스, 콘텐츠 생성 등에서 핵심 역할을 하며, Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) 기술은 정보 검색과 생성의 결합으로 더욱 정밀한 AI 서비스를 가능하게 하고 있습니다. 이러한 기술들은 금융, 의료, 제조, 미디어 등 다양한 산업에서 활용도가 높아지고 있으며, AI 기반 디지털 트윈, 3D 시각화, 가상현실 등과 결합되어 산업별 맞춤형 솔루션을 제공하고 있습니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "시장 전망도 밝습니다. 글로벌 시장조사기관은 2024년부터 2034년까지 생성형 AI 시장이 연평균 24.3% 성장하여 177억 달러 규모에 이를 것으로 예상하며, 이는 AI가 경제 전반에 미치는 영향이 점차 확대됨을 의미합니다. 특히, 기업들은 AI를 통한 생산성 향상, 비용 절감, 고객 경험 개선에 집중하며, AI 안전성과 신뢰성 확보를 위한 규제와 윤리적 가이드라인 마련도 활발히 진행되고 있습니다. 이러한 흐름은 AI의 사회적 수용성과 지속 가능성을 높이는 데 중요한 역할을 할 것으로 기대됩니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "한편, 글로벌 기업들은 AI를 활용한 혁신 경쟁에서 우위를 점하기 위해 AI 인프라와 플랫폼 개발에 막대한 투자를 하고 있으며, 특히 GPU와 AI 전용 하드웨어, API 기반 AI 서비스, AI 안전성 강화 기술 등이 핵심 이슈로 부상하고 있습니다. 또한, AI의 투명성, 설명 가능성, 윤리성 확보를 위한 연구와 정책 마련도 병행되고 있어, 산업 전반의 신뢰성 제고와 함께 AI의 책임 있는 발전이 중요한 과제로 남아 있습니다.\n",
